    "*1. Decision Trees*\n",
    "- Example application: Decision trees have been used to filter noise from Hubble Space Telescope images.\n",
    "- Advantages: easy to interpret and explain.  It takes into account feature interactions and because it is non parametric, data outliers and the linear separability of the data are less of a concern than with other methods.\n",
    "- Disadvantages: Can easily overfit to data (although this can be addressed by ensemble methods like random forests).\n",
    "- Appropriateness for problem: Divides space into regions of uniform value.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. SVM*\n",
    "- Example application: SVMs have been used in handwriting character recognition problems. It is especially popular in text recognition problems where very high dimensional spaces are the norm.\n",
    "- Advantages: good for large feature sets as it is able to separate classes more quickly and with less overfitting than many other algorithms.  It also has theoretical guarantees with regards to overfitting, and thanks to the kernel trick, it can be used even on data that is not linearly separable in the base feature space. \n",
    "- Disadvantages: hard to interpret and difficult to take into account new data.  Similar to other linear algorithms, it assumes linear class boundaries i.e. assumes that classes can be separated by a straight line (or its higher dimension analog).  This implies that data trends follow a straight line, an assumption which may not be valid for some problems.  \n",
    "- Appropriateness for problem: finds the boundary that separates classes by as wide a margin as possible.  When two classes can't be clearly separated, the algorithms find the best boundary they can.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Logistic Regression*\n",
    "- Example application: logistic regression has been used in healthcare to analyse over a million people for myocardial infarction over a 10 year period.\n",
    "- Advantages: fast and simple.  Unlike decision trees or SVMs, results have a probabilistic interpretation and models can be easily updated to take into account new data using a gradient descent method. Especially useful for problems with a probabilistic framework, or when more training data is expected in the future.\n",
    "- Disadvantages: it assumes linear class boundaries i.e. assumes that classes can be separated by a straight line (or its higher dimension analog).  This implies that data trends follow a straight line, an assumption which may not be valid for some problems.  However, despite this, linear algorithms like this tend to be a very popular 'first line of attack' as they tend to be algorithmically simpler and faster to train.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."
