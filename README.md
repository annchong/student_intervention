Assignment 2

As described in the project brief, the aim of the project is to apply supervised learning techniques to model the factors that predict 
how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, at minimum cost (i.e. with the minimum amount of computation cost/time).

The model therefore aims to predit the likelihood of a student passing their exam and quantifying whether early intervention is required.  However, given the additional condition of minimal run time, the efficient model will be a trade off between prediction accuracy and run-time.

The data set was provided by Udacity.
