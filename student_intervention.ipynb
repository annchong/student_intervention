    "**Answer: **\n",
    "3 supervised learning models that would be appropriate and their supporting details are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "** Example application:** Decision trees have been used to filter noise from Hubble Space Telescope images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:** \n",
    "* easy to interpret and explain.  \n",
    "* It takes into account feature interactions and because it is non parametric, data outliers and the linear separability of the data are less of a concern than with other methods (i.e. splitting happens based on the proportion of samples within the split ranges rather than on absolute values).\n",
    "* Does not require as much data preparation.  For example, a regression model requires data variables to be normalized or scales in order to better fit the model and interpret the model coefficients.  \n",
    "* A decision tree is also not impacted by missing values.\n",
    "* Does not require any assumption of linearity in data and is not impacted by non linear relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:** \n",
    "- Can easily overfit to data (although this can be addressed by ensemble methods like random forests).\n",
    "- Learning algorithm may be non-optimal and suffer from local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Appropriateness for problem:** \n",
    "- Decision trees implicitly perform feature selection and provides and indication of the importance of each feature.  For example, the top few nodes of a tree are the most important within the dataset.  This is desirable for this problem as it not only allows for the identification of students for intervention, it also provides insights into how to intervene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. SVM\n",
    "** Example application:** SVMs have been used in handwriting character recognition problems. It is especially popular in text recognition problems where very high dimensional spaces are the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Advantages:**\n",
    "- good for large feature sets as it is able to separate classes more quickly and with less overfitting than many other algorithms.  It is able to cope with large numbers of features as it does not operate on the source feature space explicitly.  Instead, it only calculates the 'distances' between each data point, which remains invariant with the number of features.  Hence, because instances from the training set only appear as arguments of the kernel function and even though usage of the kernels often then increase feature dimensionality (virtually) up to the infinite dimensional space, the number of 'distances' between data points does not change.  *The trade off, however, is that the number of distances increases dramatically as the number of points increases!* \n",
    "- Has theoretical guarantees with regards to overfitting, and thanks to the kernel trick, it can be used even on data that is not linearly separable in the base feature space. \n",
    "- Kernel trick also allows for the incorporation of expert domain knowledge into solving the problem via the engineering of the kernel.\n",
    "- Resulting learning algorithm is an optimized solution and avoids the 'local minimum' problem of methods like neural nets and decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Disadvantages:** \n",
    "- hard to interpret and difficult to take into account new data.  Similar to other linear algorithms, it assumes linear class boundaries i.e. assumes that classes can be separated by a straight line (or its higher dimension analog).  This implies that data trends follow a straight line, an assumption which may not be valid for some problems.  \n",
    "- Not efficient if the number of features is very large in comparison to the training samples.\n",
    "- Not especially good for multi class classification as in this instance, it is effectively a binary classifier with some kind of voting mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Appropriateness for problem:** \n",
    "- The SVM's ability to handle large number of features (31 in this example) and the fact that this is just a binary classification problem makes this a probable learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "** Example application:** logistic regression has been used in healthcare to analyse over a million people for myocardial infarction over a 10 year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Advantages:** \n",
    "- fast and simple.  \n",
    "- results have a probabilistic interpretation (unlike SVMs or decision trees) and so this method is especially useful for problems with a probabilistic framework.  \n",
    "- models can be easily updated to take into account new data using a gradient descent method.  Hence, the model is useful in instances when more training data is expected in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Disadvantages:** \n",
    "- Assumes linear class boundaries i.e. assumes that classes can be separated by a straight line (or its higher dimension analog).  This implies that data trends follow a straight line, an assumption which may not be valid for some problems.  However, despite this, linear algorithms like this tend to be a very popular 'first line of attack' as they tend to be algorithmically simpler and faster to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Appropriateness for problem:** \n",
    "- As the problem is a binary classification problem, and the result is probabilistic, this method can help to identify those students ***most*** in need of intervention.\n"

    "Dear Board of Supervisors,\n",
    "\n",
    "I write to recommend using a logistic regression model.  I make my recommendation on the basis of the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy\n",
    "- the F1 score is the metric used to measure the accuracy of the model's predictions.  The F1 value reaches its best value at 1, and its worst at 0.  \n",
    "- I have focused my attention on the predictive accuracy of each model on the test set, rather than the training set accuracy as the former is more indicative of the success of the models going forward.\n",
    "- The best test accuracy is observed with SVMs and logistic regression (\"LR\") models.  (In fact, the worst accuracy performance from both the SVM and LR models over all training set sizes is still better than the best performance from the decision tree model.)  \n",
    "- The LR model shows an improvement in its test set predictions as the number of training data points increase.  This is not what has been observed in the SVM (which has the opposite effect i.e. performance worsening as more training data points are introduced) and the decision tree models.  I therefore expect that as more data becomes available in the future, we should witness more improvements in the performance of the LR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Costs\n",
    "##### i. Training time:\n",
    "- the model with the best overall training time performance is the decision tree, followed by logistic regression and SVM.\n",
    "- As the number of training data points increase, the SVM model performance becomes significantly worse (i.e. deteriorates to less than half the speed of the other two models).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Prediction time:\n",
    "- the models with the best prediction times are the decision tree and LR models.  \n",
    "- in comparison to the other two models, the SVM is very significantly slower in predicting outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the decision tree model has the best computational performance but the worst accuracy.  Of the two remaining models, the SVM has poorer computational performance.  Hence, my recommendation is to go with the logistic regression model."

    "Regression analysis is aimed at allowing us to make predictions of an outcome based on some inputs.  In this instance, the outcome we want to predict is whether a student will fail to graduate.  The inputs we have provided is a range of socio-economic factors such as the student's family background and parents' educational levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a version of regression analysis which multiplies each input by a coefficient, sums the values and adds a constant.  The output is then simply the result of this calculation.  The training process involves determining the values of the constant and coefficients for each input that best reflect the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a regression method that builds on linear regression by applying a data transformation to force the outputs from the linear regression calculation to take on values between 0 and 1 (the output from linear regression is effectively unbounded i.e. it can be a very large or very small number as well as take on any values in between).  These values can then be interpreted as 'probabilities'.  In this example, the output can be regarded as the 'probability' that a student will fail to graduate.  Instances where the probabilities are >0.5 are then classed as 'yes' and those <=0.5 are classed as 'no'.  The training of a logistic regression model is similar to that for a linear regression model - the constant value and the coefficients of inputs are determined by maximising the accuracy of resulting predictions on the training data."
